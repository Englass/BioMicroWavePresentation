		<li><strong>Myth 1: The microwaves can leak out of the container and harm us!</strong><br/>
		A microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter.  According to the FDA:<br/>
		<br/>
		<div class="quote"><i>"A Federal standard (21 CFR 1030.10) limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts (mW) of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 2 inches from the oven surface. This limit is far below the level known to harm people. Microwave energy also decreases dramatically as you move away from the source of radiation. 
		The standard also requires all ovens to have two independent interlock systems that stop the production of microwaves the moment the latch is released or the door is opened. In addition, a monitoring system stops oven operation in case one or both of the interlock systems fail."(1)</i>
		</div>

		<br/>With the interlocking systems in place, even if there are slight leakages, the amount of microwave radiation is significantly less than your cellphones, and thus wouldn't harm you. Not only that, the Microwave's metal compartment and metal mesh screen are non-penetrable by microwaves. Due to current technology and regulations, it is nonsensical to be worrying about microwave radiation leakage as a cause of cancer.

		<li><strong>Myth 2: The way microwaves cook food causes the food to be carcinogenic!</strong><br/>
	
		This myth started with two dumb scientists: Hans Hertel and William Kopp. They conducted a study in which they ate nothing but microwaved food for two months. After those two months, they found that they appeared to be in cancerous conditions.(2) Their studies were so incomplete and contained so many fallacies that no one has even been able to recreate their studies. A hypothesis needs to be observable and reproduceable. Since those studies can't be reproduced, the hypothesis must be thrown out. In fact, repeated studies have shown quite the opposite. Jim Felton, associate director for cancer control at UCDavis showed that by microwaving meat before grilling it, the potential carcinogens in the meat itself was all gone. Not only that, microwaving retains more nutrients than other forms of cooking if you don't use alot of water and don't overcook the food.(2)
		<br/> With any merit, and with many backed up counter claims, this myth is debunked as well.
