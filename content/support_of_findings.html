		<li><strong>Myth 1: The microwaves can leak out of the container and harm us!</strong><br/>
		A microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter.  According to the FDA:<br/>

		<i>"A Federal standard (21 CFR 1030.10) limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts (mW) of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 2 inches from the oven surface. This limit is far below the level known to harm people. Microwave energy also decreases dramatically as you move away from the source of radiation. 
		The standard also requires all ovens to have two independent interlock systems that stop the production of microwaves the moment the latch is released or the door is opened. In addition, a monitoring system stops oven operation in case one or both of the interlock systems fail."<i>

		<br/>Due to current technology and regulations, it is non-sensible to be worrying about microwave radiation leakage as a huge cause of carcinogen.

		<li><strong>Myth 2: The way microwaves cook food causes the food to be carcinogenic!</strong><br/>
	
		This myth started with dumb scientists, two specifically: Hans Hertel and William Kopp. Their studies were so incomplete and contained so many fallacies that no one has even been able to recreate their studies. A hypothesis needs to be observable and reproduceable. Since those studies can't be reproduced, the hypothesis must be thrown out. In fact, repeated studies have shown quite the opposite. Jim Felton, associate director for cancer control at UCDavis showed that by microwaving meat before grilling it, the potential carcinogens in the meat itself was all gone. Not only that, microwaving retains more nutrients than other forms of cooking if you don't use alot of water and overcook the food. Regarding plastics and whatnot, it's chemically impossible since the precursors for dioxin are not in plastic wrap.*
