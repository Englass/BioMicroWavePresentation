	The life long question that many try to answer: <strong>Do Microwaves Cause Cancer?</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	&emsp;&emsp;
	With the industrial boom of the 18th century, new inventions came about. With new inventions came a string of curiosity and doubt towards the integrity of the inventions. This was due to the lack of knowledge on the part of the public, during a time when education was scarce and only for the rich. One invention that has garnered the attention and doubt of many is the Microwave oven. Invented during the year of 1946 by American engineer Percy Spencer, the Microwave oven, to many, seemed to work on magic. I think the name “Microwave Oven” has to do with the product’s skepticism as this was during the time when nuclear testing/weapons was prevalent in people’s lives, and thus the idea of waves is scary in and of itself. <br/>

	&emsp;&emsp;
	The Microwave oven was actually invented on accident by American electrical engineer Percy Spencer. Percy Spencer was carrying out some experiments with a magnetron at the Raytheon Manufacturing Company where he worked. During that time, the magnetron was used in radar, and it used radio waves to help airplanes and ships navigate in the dark. One day, Spencer had a chocolate bar in his pocket, and when he switched on the magnetron, he noticed that the bar melted very quickly due to the heat the magnetron generated. From this, he got the idea that the magnetron could be used to cook food.<br/><br/>

	&emsp;&emsp;The two ways microwaves are thought to cause cancer are: <strong> Microwave Leakage</strong> and <strong>Turning The food Into Carcinogens</strong>. The first myth is without merit. However the second one isn't. The second one was created by a scientist named Hans Hertel who poorly conducted a study whereby he consumed milk and vegetables prepared in the microwave for two months and claimed that his blood appeared in to be in cancerous conditions.*<br/><br/>


	&emsp;&emsp;Knowledge was very scarce, and people were very gullible as they had no means to disprove rumors. It's not clear why so many people are so skeptical about microwave ovens. "Maybe it's because there's no obvious reason why the food cooks," offers physicist Louis Bloomfield of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who answers questions about microwaves at howthingswork.virginia.edu. And thus due to people's lack of knowledge regarding technology, many invention-related myths were created, and still held dearly by many today.<br/>
