	The life long question that many try to answer: <strong>Do Microwaves Cause Cancer?</strong>
	With the industrial boom of the 18th century, new inventions came about. With new inventions came a string of curiosity and doubt towards the integrity of the inventions. This was due to the lack of knowledge on the part of the public, during a time when education was scarce and only for the rich. One invention that has garnered the attention and doubt of many is the Microwave oven. Invented during the year of 1946 by American engineer Percy Spencer, the Microwave oven, to many, seemed to work on magic. I think the name “Microwave Oven” has to do with the product’s skepticism as this was during the time when nuclear testing/weapons was prevalent in people’s lives, and thus the idea of waves is scary in and of itself. <br/>
	The Microwave oven was actually invented on accident by American electrical engineer Percy Spencer. Percy Spencer was carrying out some experiments with a magnetron, which is an electron tube for amplifying or generating microwaves with the flow of electrons being controlled by an external magnetic field, at the Raytheon Manufacturing Company where he worked. During that time, the magnetron was used in radar, and it used radio waves to help airplanes and ships navigate in the dark. <br/>
	One day, Spencer had a chocolate bar in his pocket, and when he switched on the magnetron, he noticed that the bar melted very quickly due to the head the magnetron generated. From this, he got the idea that the magnetron could be used to cook food.<br/>

	<br/>However, knowledge was very scarce, and people were very gullible as they had no means to disprove rumors. And thus due to people's lack of knowledge ragarding technology, many invention related myths were created, and still held dearly by many today.
