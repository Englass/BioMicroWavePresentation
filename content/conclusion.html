<div class="post_wide conclusion">
	By expanding our knowledge so that we know a little bit of everything, we are able to better understand the world and think for ourselves. When I was young, I was forced to listen to crazy myths, and I actually believed them because I didn't know enough to call them wrong. But now, with more access to knowledge and an ever developing brain(god bless I'm not 25 yet), I am able to gain a better understanding of the everday world.<br/>

<span style="">DEBUNKED!!!!</span></strong><br/>
