		<li> Inside the metal box is a magnetron, a device which generates microwaves by magnetic induction. These waves are roughly 12 centimeters long, and can penetrate the surface of food fairly easily.</li>
		<li> The waves make their way into the food compartment through a channel called a wave guide.</li>
		<li> The food resides on the turntable which helps the wave reach each angle so as to cook it evenly.</li>
		<li> The microwaves bounce back and forth off the reflective metal walls of the food compartment. The microwaves penetrate the food. As they travel through it, they excite the molecules of the foot, making them move very quickly.</li>
		<li> Vibrating molecules have heat so, the faster the molecules vibrate, the hotter the food becomes. Thus the microwaves pass their energy onto the molecules in the food, rapidly heating it up.*</li>
